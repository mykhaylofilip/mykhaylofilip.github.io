# Experience with WSL
I recently installed WSL. My virtual machine was not starting correctly because of some errors. After attempting to debug for around 3 hours, I decided to install WSL instead. Without getting into it in depth, right away I saw the following:

**Pros:**
- More connected with Windows (integrated Windows-Linux system)
- Quicker file sharing
- Lightweight
- Faster startup
- Better performance

**Cons:**
- Security issues (no isolation)
- No GUI
- Network limitations
- No full snapshot/restore capabilities
