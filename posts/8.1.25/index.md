# Exploring VPN Protocols
I dug deeper into how VPNs work and discovered the differences between protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard, and IKEv2.  

Each protocol has trade-offs: OpenVPN is highly compatible and secure, WireGuard is faster and simpler, and IKEv2 is good for mobile devices because it handles network changes well.  

Understanding VPN protocols is useful not just for privacy, but also for learning about encryption, tunneling, and secure communication in networks. It’s one of those topics that bridges practical use and technical understanding.
