# Lubuntu 
A while back I got my hands on a old Aspire One. the condition of the device was fairly great with no major scratch. The battery had around 6 hours of lifetime and although the 2 core Intel atom could only run 32 bit architect, I decided to install Lubuntu on it. More specifically Lubuntu 18.04 32 Bit. After doing a bit of customizing the Netbook could run various things, such as Wire shark, Game boy Advanced emulators, and so much other programs that I haven't tested yet. In fact I am writing this post on my netbook, with very minimal lag. the only problem that I saw was loading YouTube videos or videos in general. 

I also did some customization to the little machine. I added a Solid State Drive that was 128 GB, increased the RAM from 1 to 2 GB and, replaced some old screws. The system ran much smother from HDD to SSD. In general I found bringing this old system back to life very fun.
