# ReviOS
For about 10 months, I have been using ReviOS. It is a customized version of Windows. It supports both Windows 10 and 11, which can be nifty to a user's preference. For starters, ReviOS reduces RAM usage drastically. Of course, this can vary from system to system, but with a base Windows system, it can have up to a GB reduction of RAM. It can be utilized for gaming or for systems that slow down when running normal Windows. It can be installed through the Revision Playbook. This playbook has a variety of features that just make it easy for users. For example, one of my favorite features, Superfetch. It speeds up boot time and program load time by preloading necessary data into memory. This is extremely useful for HDD users.

With my 10 months of usage, I have had 0 problems. That's not to say there aren't problems. They have a fairly active Discord server where users with problems can ask for help. Their GitHub is also open source, and I will leave a link to it at the bottom of the page. ReviOS advertises that they remove classic Windows surveillance. This is a great feature to keep your data safe and away from big corporate companies. Along with this, you can enable and disable certain features that Windows has pre-installed with the flick of a button in their Playbook. For example, User Account Control, which limits applications to standard user privileges unless an administrator authorizes an elevation. Lastly, ReviOS promises stability, and seeing that I haven't encountered a single problem while using ReviOS, I deem this to be true. Overall, ReviOS is a great version of Windows for gaming, privacy, and usability.
