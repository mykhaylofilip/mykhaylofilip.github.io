# NCL
Each season before NCL, I try to download a couple of tools that could help me for the challenge. I focus on tools that cover areas like network scanning, cryptography, and forensics.  

For example, I usually set up Wireshark for analyzing network traffic, hashcat for cracking hashes, and various Linux utilities for file and system analysis. Having these tools ready beforehand helps me save time during the competition.  

I also make sure I’m familiar with each tool’s basic commands and workflows. Practicing ahead of time means I can focus on problem-solving during the actual event instead of struggling with the software.  

Participating in NCL has really improved my skills in scripting, vulnerability analysis, and teamwork. Each challenge teaches me new techniques and reinforces concepts I’ve learned in labs and courses.  

Overall, NCL is a fun, fast-paced way to test practical cybersecurity skills and see how well I can apply what I’ve learned under pressure.

But I DESPISE web exploitation :sob:
