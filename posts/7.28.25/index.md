# Brave Password Manager
I use the default Brave password manager.  

I understand why some people say it might not be secure. It’s practically a key that unlocks all the other keys, which doesn’t make much sense. If my machine ever gets compromised, there’s a good chance the rest of my passwords might also be exposed.  

Still, I’ll always use a password manager for a few simple reasons. First of all, there’s that extra layer of security. The passwords are encrypted on my device, so even if I were directly compromised, the passwords aren’t stored in plaintext or anything like that.  

Not to mention the huge time savings. Instead of forgetting my passwords or digging through files to find them, I have them saved and can unlock them easily with one main password.  

The master password I use for my manager is more than 20 characters long and not repetitive.  

Finally, I love that I don’t need two different managers. Since Brave syncs with my phone, all my passwords stay up to date automatically. I never have to worry about adding or removing passwords on one device and forgetting to do the same on the other.
