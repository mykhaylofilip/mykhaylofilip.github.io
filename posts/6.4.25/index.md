# Google Cybersecurity Certificate
Recently, I acquired the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. To be honest, the course explored very basic concepts and didn’t go in depth on many topics.

For example, there were only two modules on SQL and Python. Other than that, the course was very informative. Google did a great job condensing a large amount of information into a single, easy-to-follow course.

Google lists the course as a 168-hour, 6-month program (around 8 hours a week). I ended up completing it in about a month.

I might pursue different courses from Google on Coursera in the future. Some of these might include the UNIX Design course or a more advanced Python automation course. Overall, I’m happy with the experience and would rate it like this:

**(Scale is out of 10)**  
- Difficulty: 4  
- Information: 8  
- Engagement: 7  
- Structure: 8  
- Practical Usefulness: 4
