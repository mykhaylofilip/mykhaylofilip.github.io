# Exponential Cryptology with Keys - (ECK)
First of all I have to mention this is a proof of concept and has lots of flaws. This is by no means any method to keep data secure and can be broken increadibly easily. This has also been found out in some form or another at some point.

This method works by first assigning each letter or character a number. Atleast numbers past 100. Also dont skip 10s and 5s. There is just a quick sample table below. 

|Character | Number |
|:---------|:---------|
|A|101|
|B|102|
|C|103|
|D|104|
|E|106|
|F|107|
|G|108|
|H|109|
|I|111|
|J|112|
|K|113|
|L|114|
|M|116|
|N|117|
|O|118|
|P|119|
|Q|121|
|R|122|
|S|123|
|T|124|
|U|126|
|V|127|
|W|128|
|X|129|
|Y|131|
|Z|132|
|(Space)|133|
