Hi, I’m Mykhaylo Filip — a 16-year-old cybersecurity and math enthusiast passionate about solving complex problems, building projects, and sharing knowledge. But this space is more than just a GitHub page, it’s my personal hub for growth, where I document my journey, showcase my achievements, and post summaries that reflect my curiosity and commitment to learn.

I believe in making cybersecurity approachable and valuable. Everything here is open source and part of my portfolio, so feel free to explore the nested list in the Browse section below. Just remember to follow my [license](https://github.com/mykhaylofilip/mykhaylofilip.github.io/blob/main/LICENSE) — collaboration and community are amazing.
