Hello! Welcome to my website. I am a 16 year old Cyber and Math enthusiast, just looking to build a portfolio and learn valuable skills. This is a simple Github Page website, but its more than enough for anything that I will post. You can expect projects, posts, guides, and summaries. To browse this website you can use the nested list in the Browse Section, which is just below. 

If you would like to contact me you can do so through one of the following:
