Hello! Welcome to my website. I am a 16 year old Cyber and Math enthusiast, just looking to build a portfolio and learn valuable skills.

Further more I would like to mention this entire website is open source. Just make sure to abide by my [License](https://github.com/mykhaylofilip/mykhaylofilip.github.io/blob/main/LICENSE).
